		<h2 class="header">Description</h2>
		<p>
			An epitome of Japanese soul food, oyakodon (親子丼) literally translates
			to parent-and-child (oya-ko) rice bowl (don) as the dish is composed of
			chicken and egg.
		</p>

		<h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>½ onion</li>
			<li>10 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
			<li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
			<li>3–4 large eggs</li>
			<li>½ cup dashi (Japanese soup stock)</li>
			<li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
			<li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
			<li>2 tsp sugar</li>
			<li>2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
			<li>4 sprigs mitsuba (Japanese parsley)</li>
			<li>shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) (optional)</li>
			<li>Japanese sansho pepper (optional)</li>
		</ul>

			<ol class="list">
				<li>
					With the stove off, add the sliced onions to a medium frying pan in a
					single layer. Then, add the seasonings mixture. It should just cover
					the onions. If not, your frying pan is too big and you need to either
					increase the seasoning or use a smaller pan.
				</li>
				<li>
					Turn on the heat to medium and bring it to a simmer. Once simmering,
					add the chicken on top of the onions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make sure the onions and chicken are evenly distributed. Once
					simmering again, lower the heat to medium low. Cook, uncovered, for 5
					minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink and the onions are
					tender. Halfway through, flip the chicken. Tip: Evaporation reduces
					the sauce and intensifies the flavor.
				</li>
				<li>
					We will add the eggs in two stages: Two-thirds of the eggs first, then
					the remaining one-third later. Now, increase the heat to medium. With
					the cooking liquid simmering (small bubbles around the edges), drizzle
					two-thirds of the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and
					onions, avoiding the edges of the pan where the eggs can easily
					overcook. Tip: Only drizzle the eggs if the cooking liquid is
					simmering, as with Egg Drop Soup. Also, try to add more egg whites at
					this stage, as the whites take longer to cook than the yolks. Ideally,
					we want to keep the yolks soft and runny for the final presentation.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the heat is too strong, lower the heat. If the egg is moving toward
					the edges of the pan, gently gather it toward the center where the
					heat is not as strong. Optionally, you can cover the pan if the egg
					whites are taking a long time to set.
				</li>
				<li>
					When the eggs are still runny but just set, add the rest of the eggs
					to the center and around the edges of the pan. Add the mitsuba (or
					green onion) on top and cook on medium low until the egg is done to
					your liking. Usually, oyakodon in Japan is served while the egg is
					almost set but still runny (raw eggs are safe to consume in Japan).
					Tip: For the remaining one-third of the egg, try to distribute more
					egg yolks so the oyakodon will have a bright yellow color on top. For
					a good presentation, you can add a beaten extra yolk at the end.
				</li>
				<li>
					Serve steamed rice in individual serving bowls. Spoon the cooked
					chicken and egg mixture onto the steamed rice and drizzle the desired
					amount of pan sauce on top.
				</li>
			</ol>
