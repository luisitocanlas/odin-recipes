				<li>
					Rinse oxtail under cold, running water and with a knife, trim excess
					fat. In a deep pot, place oxtails and enough water to cover. Over
					medium heat, bring to a boil, skimming any scum that accumulates to
					top. Lower heat, cover and simmer, adding more water as needed to
					maintain 6 cups, for about 2 to 3 hours or until oxtails are easily
					pierced with a fork. Drain oxtail, reserving about 6 cups broth.
				</li>
				<li>
					Peel and discard the outer, fibrous skin layers of banana heart until
					you reach the lighter, softer core. Trim off stem and discard. Cut
					banana core into half and into fourths. In a bowl of cold salted
					water, place cut banana and soak for about 15 to 20 minutes. Using
					hands, squeeze to release bitter sap. Rinse with cold water and drain
					well, discarding liquid.
				</li>
				<li>
					In a pot over medium heat, bring about 4 cups water to a boil. Add
					banana heart and blanch for about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon,
					remove from liquid and set aside. Add eggplant and blanch for about 1
					minute. With a slotted spoon, remove from liquid and set aside. Add
					long beans and blanch for about 1 minute. With a slotted spoon, remove
					from liquid and set aside. Add pechay and blanch for about 30 seconds.
					With a slotted spoon, remove from liquid and set aside.
				</li>
				<li>
					In a skillet over medium heat, add rice flour and cook, stirring
					occasionally, until lightly browned and toasted. In a bowl, combine
					toasted rice flour and ¼ cup reserved broth and whisk until smooth.
				</li>
				<li>
					In a small bowl, combine annatto powder and ¼ cup reserved broth. Stir
					until powder is dissolved and color has dispersed.
				</li>
				<li>
					In a bowl, combine peanut butter and ½ cup of reserved broth and stir
					until well-blended.
				</li>
				<li>
					In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and
					cook until limp and aromatic. Add oxtail and cook, stirring
					occasionally, until lightly browned. Add fish sauce and cook for about
					2 to 3 minutes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Add the remaining 5 cups of reserved broth and bring to a simmer. Add
					annatto water, rice flour mixture and peanut butter mixture, stirring
					well to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue to
					simmer for about 10 minutes or until it begins to slightly thicken.
					Add blanched vegetables and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until
					heated through and tender yet crisp. Serve hot with shrimp paste on
					the side.
